Old MacDonald had a farm, EE-I-EE-I-O,
And on that farm he had a cow, EE-I-EE-I-O,
With a moo moo here and a moo moo there
Here a moo, there a moo, everywhere a moo moo
Old MacDonald had a farm, EE-I-EE-I-O.

Old MacDonald had a farm, EE-I-EE-I-O,
And on that farm he had a dog, EE-I-EE-I-O,
With a woof woof here and a woof woof there
Here a woof, there a woof, everywhere a woof woof
Old MacDonald had a farm, EE-I-EE-I-O.
